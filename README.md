This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You'll need to have these environment variables:

- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID - The Spotify client ID
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET - The Spotify client secret
- OPENAI_API_KEY - Your OpenAI key

Follow the [Getting Started](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) on the Spotify site to create a new App with "web api" permissions to get the client ID and secret.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
